# VHS Collection

This is a project I developed for the [Zentral- und Landesbibliothek Berlin](https://www.zlb.de/en/about-us/about-us/about-us.html) with the purpose of finding out which of their VHS tapes can be replaced with DVDs and which need to be digitized.

The film metadata is gathered from the [OFDB](https://ssl.ofdb.de/view.php?page=erwsuche), which is old and slow. So if you try to run this program, do yourself a favor and just download the cached data [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17qHa_zsJLkqBHIRn8So3HfTn2m5ttn3G/view?usp=sharing) and put it in the input/ofdb directory.
